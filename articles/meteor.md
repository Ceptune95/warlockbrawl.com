**Meteor** is a damage dealing crowd-control projectile ability belonging to the <kbd>E</kbd> column of spells. It has two modes: *Meteorite* and *Magma*.

## Meteorite

The target area will be blasted upon impact by the indestructible meteor missile.

## Magma

The meteor missile crawls forward, dealing damage to and pushing away opponents while destroying anything else it encounters. It explodes upon reaching its range and deals damage in a small area based on how much damage it took from projectiles. It will instantly explode upon impact with another magma, a [shield](shield.html) or a pillar.
