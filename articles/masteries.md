Masteries are unique tech routes in Warlock that increase the effectiveness of the player's every ability. There are four available masteries: *Duration*, *range*, *life steal* and *jack of all trades*.

## Duration

Mastering duration increases the duration of every buff and curse cast by the player, every buff received by the player and every channeled spell cast by the player.

## Range

Mastering range increases the range of all spells cast by the player.

## Life steal

Mastering life steal grants an increasing life steal for all damage dealt by the player.

## Jack of all trades

But master of none: Upgrades all three masteries at a discounted price.
