**Thrust** is a space shifting ability that belongs to the <kbd>R</kbd> column of spells. It has two modes: *Strike* and *Ghost*.

### Strike

The caster accelerates towards the cast point. While accelerating, collision with other opponents will deal damage to them and halt the caster's velocity.

### Ghost

The caster indefinitely accelerates in the direction of the cast point. While accelerating, all collision for the caster is disabled. Acceleration can only be stopped if the caster resumes normal movement.
