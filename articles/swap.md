**Swap** is a space shifting mobility ability belonging to the <kbd>R</kbd> column of spells. It has two modes: *Displacement* and *Relocate*.

### Displacement

The swap missile instantly swaps the positions of its target and the caster. Upon reaching its maximum range, the caster will be transported to the missile without swapping anything.

### Relocate

Relocate instantly swaps the positions of the projectile nearest to the cast point and the caster. If a pillar is nearer than any projectile, the caster will be transported to it without swapping. For non-pillar swaps, a temporary movement speed bonus is granted.
