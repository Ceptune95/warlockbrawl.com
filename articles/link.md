**Link** is a multipurpose projectile ability belonging to the <kbd>Y</kbd> column of spells. It has a linear trajectory and returns to its caster upon reaching its range. It has two modes: *Hook* and *Induction*.

## Hook

Upon impact, the link missile will indefinitely link the caster and target together. When linked, an opponent will be pulled towards the caster and take damage, while an ally will only be pulled. When linked to a pillar, the caster will be pulled towards it instead. The link can be broken under any of these conditions:

- The two collide with each other.
- The linked opponent uses their <kbd>C</kbd> spell.
- The linked opponent casts their <kbd>F</kbd> spell while the caster is positioned on lava.
- The linked ally issues a special command (*hold position*, <kbd>H</kbd>).
- The caster cancels the spell.
- Either of the two are destroyed.

The link missile can be pulled back or canceled in mid-air at any time by the caster.

## Induction

Upon impact, the link missile will indefinitely link the caster and target together. When linked to an opponent, they will take damage and the caster will be pulled towards them. This link can be broken under any of these conditions:

- The two collide with each other.
- The linked opponent uses their <kbd>C</kbd> spell.
- The caster cancels the spell.
- Either of the two are destroyed.

When linked to an ally or pillar, the link will deal damage to all opponents caught in it and grant a movement speed bonus to the caster. The duration of this link can be increased by the caster at the cost of hitpoints. The caster can additionally create a static link while the missile is in mid-air which will not grant movement speed bonus.
