      Warlock, or Warlock Brawl, is a game concept that has had incarnations spanning multiple platforms. Its most well-known is the #[a(href="/download/") Warcraft III map], a mod for the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne") 2003 Blizzard game], which underwent active development for over six years. In 2014, the mod was ported by the original team to #[a(href="/dota/") Dota 2] and was the focus for Warlock for around two years.
    p.
      As well as modifications of games, Warlock has existed as a #[a(href="/about/standalones.html") myriad of standalone game projects] typically started by indie developers inspired by the WC3 map. There is currently an official standalone project in development, lead by original co-creator Adynathos.
    p.
      Today, while not actively updated, both mod versions will receive the occasional patch, usually in response to changes on their respective platforms. The standalone project is not actively being worked on either, but remains the end goal for Warlock.
