    h2.m-t-2 List of Warlock-inspired games
    p.
      This is by no means an exhaustive list. Many of these are only known because their creators came to our forums to ask about permissions/licenses or sometimes just to mingle. For others it's been serendipity. The point is there are a lot of these.

            td This project was not being developed by the original Warlock team, but both were in close communication. It was also one of the more anticipated standalones, having been in development during Warlock's peak (and then setting the bar for standalones to come by dissipating after a couple of months of work.)
