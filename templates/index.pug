    h2 Welcome to Warlock
    p.
      Warlock, or Warlock Brawl, is a game concept that has had incarnations spanning multiple platforms. Its most well known is the #[a(href="/download/") Warcraft III map], a mod for the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne") 2003 Blizzard game], which underwent active development for over six years. In 2014, it was ported by the original team to #[a(href="/dota/") Dota 2] which ended up being the focus for Warlock for around two years.
    p.
      Today, while not actively updated, both mod versions will still receive the occasional patch. This is usually done in response to changes made on their respective platforms, but new features are sometimes added too.
    p.
      As well as modifications of games, Warlock has existed as a #[a(href="/about/standalones.html") myriad of standalone game projects] typically started by indie developers inspired by the WC3 map. There is currently an official standalone project in development, lead by original co-creator Adynathos.
