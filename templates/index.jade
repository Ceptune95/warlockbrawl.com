    h2 Welcome to Warlock
    p.
      Warlock, or Warlock Brawl, is a game concept that has had incarnations spanning multiple platforms. Its most well-known is the Warcraft III map, a mod for the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne") 2003 Blizzard game], which underwent active development for over 6 years. Since July 2014, efforts by the original team to port the mod from this archaic platform to #[a(href="/dota") Dota 2] have been the primary focus for Warlock.
    p.
      As well as modifications of games, Warlock has existed as a myriad of standalone game projects, the majority of which undertaken by unaffiliated indie developers who had been inspired by the WC3 map. You can see a list of #[em known] Warlock-inspired games #[a(href="standalones.html") here]. There is currently an under-the-radar standalone project in development, lead by original co-creator Adynathos.
    h3 As a game
