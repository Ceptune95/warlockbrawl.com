  h2 Prerequisites
  p.
    In order to play Warlock, you must have #[a(href="https://www.battle.net/shop/en-us/product/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos") Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos] and its expansion, #[a(href="https://www.battle.net/shop/en-us/product/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne") The Frozen Throne], installed on your computer.
  ul
    li
      a(href="https://www.battle.net/shop/en-us/product/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos") Get a copy Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos
    li
      a(href="https://www.battle.net/shop/en-us/product/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne") Get a copy of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne
  p.
    With a copy of Warcraft III, you can log into Battle.net straight away and start browsing custom games. However, if you're specifically looking to play Warlock, it's recommended to use dedicated 3rd party clients.

  h2 Clients
  p.
    3rd party clients typically offer a more streamlined experience for playing Warlock, with dedicated low-latency servers out of the box and easier ways to organize games. Furthermore, they do not require a valid CD key to play.

  h3 RGC
  p.
    #[a(href="http://rankedgaming.com/") #[abbr(title="Ranked Gaming Client") RGC]] is a multi-region Warcraft III client. It has American, European and Asian servers optimal for low-latency Warlock. To set up, follow these steps:
  ol
    li #[a(href="http://rankedgaming.com/") Download the client from their website] and run it.
    li Register an account through the client and log in.
    li Open your settings, navigate to the "Dota" section, and set the path to your Warcraft III executable.
      ul
        li (Optional) #[a(href="https://iccup.com/dota/dota_start.html") Download and use ICCup's version of Warcraft III] and use that for RGC. This will mean you'll have a separate Warcraft III fixed on patch 1.26a.
    li Save and close settings and type in #[code /j (EU) Warlock] to join the main European channel. Also available are #[code (US) Warlock], #[code (SA) Warlock] and #[code (Asia) Warlock]. From there, you can host/see a list of open games.
    li To join a game, launch Warcraft III through the "Start" button on RGC (see step 3), enter Local Area Network, and you should see the list of open games there.

  h3 ICCup
  p.
    #[a(href="https://iccup.com/") ICCup] is a Russian Warcraft III client. It does have at least one EU server, but the rest are Russian. To set up, follow these steps:
  ol
    li
      a(href="https://iccup.com/en/register.html") Register an account on their website.
    li
      a(href="https://iccup.com/en/files.html") Download and run their launcher.
    li Now either set the Warcraft III path to your copy of it, or #[a(href="https://iccup.com/dota/dota_start.html") download theirs]. Downloading their copy will make dealing with different patches easier, as theirs is fixed on patch 1.26a.
    li When Warcraft III is launched, enter Battle.net (make sure #[code The Abyss(ICCup)] is set as the gateway).
    li Log in using your ICCup username and password you created earlier.
    li Enter any channel, and type in #[code /j op lock] to enter the Warlock channel where you can join/host games.
